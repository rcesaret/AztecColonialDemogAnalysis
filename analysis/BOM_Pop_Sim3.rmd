This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Life Table Calc Workflow


### PctBirths by Age Interpolation

% of total births by age group estimated from:
https://www.jstor.org/stable/42778266
https://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?pid=S1665-44202022000100044&script=sci_arttext
Modified to slant slightly younger
Then using the CBRs and age structure for Coale and Demney models 1-3-8 West, these percentages were converted to Age specific fertility rates (ASFRs)

interpolation_ages <- seq(0, 99, by = 1) # Every integer from 0 to 90
# Perform spline interpolation
#interpolated_ASFR <- spline(CD_ASFR$AgeMidpoint, CD_ASFR$PctBirths, xout = interpolation_ages, method = "natural")
fit_loess <- loess(CD_ASFR$PctBirths ~ CD_ASFR$AgeMidpoint, span = 0.22, degree=2)
interpolated_PctBirths <- as.data.frame(interpolation_ages)

Coale and Demeny Life table Variables

1000 q(x) = nqx = Probability at age x of dying before reaching age x + n

d(x) = ndx = Number of deaths between age x and x + n out of an original cohort of 100,000

1000 m(x) = nmx = Death rate in the life table population (number of deaths per person-years lived) between age x and x + n.

l(x) = lx = Number of survivors at age x out of an original cohort of 100,000.

L(x) = nLx = Number of person-years lived between age x and x + n by an original cohort of 100,000. This column gives the age distribution in a stationary population with 100,000 annual births and deaths.

P(x) = The proportion of persons in a given five year age group in the stationary population alive five years later. Note however that the entry after age zero in this column in P(birth), [5L0/5/0]; and that the entry after age 1 is P(0-4), [5L5/5L0]; and that the entry after age 95 is Γ(100)/Γ(95), [Γ10ο/Γ95].

T(x) = Tx = Number of person-years lived at age x and over by an original cohort of 100,000.

e(x) = ex = Average number of years remaining to be lived (expectation of life) at age x



#####demogR

Life Table Inputs:

x	= age at the beginning of the interval

nDx = deaths (counts)

nKx = population size (counts)

you can calculate nDx and nKx from Coale and Demeny



Life Table Variables

x	= age at the beginning of the interval

*nax	= person-years lived by those dying in the interval x to x+n

nMx	= period central death rate

nqx	= probability of death between ages x and x+n

lx	= probability of survival to exact age x

ndx	= proportion of deaths occurring between ages x and x+n

nLx	= person-years lived in the interval x to x+n

Tx = person-years of life left in the cohort at age x

ex = life expectancy at age x

## Construct lx and mx values

mlt <- with(goodman, life.table(x=age, nDx=mad.nDx, nKx=mad.nKx))
